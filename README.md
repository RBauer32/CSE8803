## Dependencies
To run our code you will need to download
matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, captum

Github for captum can be found here https://github.com/pytorch/captum

## Data Generation

To generate synthetic data for an SEIRM model run seirm_ode_data_generation.py


The model parameters values at the bottom determine the ODE parameters that will be used to generate the curve.
There is also premade synthetic data in the data folder that was used to generate results.

## Model Evaluation
Our model can be found in main.py. To train the model on the synthetic data generated by seirm_ode_data_generation.py, run main.py with data_directory set to the directory in which the synthetic data is located.

## Model Explainability
We use the Integrated Gradients method from Captum to analyze our network. All model explainability code can be found in model_explainability.py.
